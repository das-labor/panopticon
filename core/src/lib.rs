//! A library for disassembling and analysing binary code.
//!
//! The panopticon crate implements structures to model the in-memory representation of a
//! program including is control flow, call graph and memory maps.
//! The most important types and their interaction are as follows:
//!
//! ```text
//! Project
//! ├── Region
//! │   └── Layer
//! └── Program
//!     └── Function
//!         └── BasicBlock
//!             └── Mnemonic
//!                 └── Statement
//! ```
//!
//! The [`Program`](program/index.html), [`Function`](function/index.html),
//! [`BasicBlock`](basic_block/index.html) and [`Statement`](il/struct.Statement.html)
//! types model the behaviour of code.
//! The [`Region`](region/index.html) and [`Layer`](layer/index.html) types
//! represent how the program is laid out in memory.
//!
//! # Code
//!
//! Panopticon models code as a collection of programs. Each
//! [`Program`](program/index.html) consists of functions. A [`Function`](function/index.html) a graph with nodes representing a
//! sequence of instructions and edges representing jumps. These instruction sequences are [`BasicBlock`s](basic_block/index.html)
//! and contain a list of [`Mnemonic`](mnemonic/index.html)s. The meaning of each
//! `Mnemonic` is described in the [RREIL][1] language. Each mnemonic includes a sequence of
//! [`Statement`s](il/struct.Statement.html) implementing it.
//!
//! Panopticon allows multiple programs per project. For example, imagine a C# application that calls into a
//! native DLL written in C. Such an application would have two program instances. One for the CIL
//! code of the C# part of the application and one for the AMD64 object code inside the DLL.
//!
//! The [`Disassembler`](disassembler/index.html) and [`CodeGen`](codegen/index.html) are used to fill `Function`
//! structures with `Mnemonic`s.
//!
//! # Data
//!
//! The in-memory layout of an executable is modeled using the [`Region`](region/index.html), [`Layer`](layer/index.html) and
//! [`Cell`](layer/type.Cell.html) types. All data is organized into `Region`s. Each `Region` is an array of
//! `Cell`s numbered from 0 to n. Each `Cell` is an is either
//! undefined or has a value between 0 and 255 (both including). `Region`s are read
//! only. Changing their contents is done by applying `Layer` instance to them. A `Layer`
//! reads part of a `Region` or another `Layer` and returns a new `Cell` array. For example, `Layer`
//! can decrypt parts of a `Region` or replace individual `Cell`s with new
//! ones.
//!

//! In normal operation there is one `Region` for each memory address space, one on
//! Von-Neumann machines two on Harvard architectures. Other uses for `Region`s are
//! applying functions to `Cell` array where the result is not equal in size to the
//! input (for example uncompressing parts of the executable image).
