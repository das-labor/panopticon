# For maintainers & reviewers
 1. Assume good faith.
 1. Please have fun, nobody is paid for developing Panopticon.
 1. Everything is up to debate, none of the following guidelines are set in stone.
 1. Check Whether contributed code:
     1. scales reasonably well,
     1. has no (obvious) security problems,
     1. isn't reimplementing features that already exist in Panopticon,
     1. is in the right place,
     1. comes w/ unit tests that demonstrate the code works and make sure it can be changed later,
     1. includes legible documentation.
1. No bikeshedding about naming, brace placement, argument order, "taste" or "style".
1. If in doubt, merge.
1. Please thank the contributor. It costs nothing. Also, see 2.
