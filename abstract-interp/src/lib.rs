//! Abstract Interpretation Framework.
//!
//! Abstract Interpretation executes an program over sets of concrete values. Each operation is
//! extended to work on some kind of abstract value called abstract domain that approximates a
//! set of concrete values (called the concrete domain). A simple example is the domain of signs.
//! Each value can either be positive, negative, both or none. An abstract interpretation will first
//! replace all constant values with their signs and then execute all basic blocks using the
//! abstract sign domain. For example multiplying two positive values yields a positive value.
//! Adding a positive and a negative sign yields an abstract value representing both signs (called
//! join).
